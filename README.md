# StravaAnalysis
An Analysis of all my Strava Data Since 2018. I was curious how my running duration, distance and paces have changed since I started running. I've also gotten hurt and sick in the past 6 years which have hindered my training and motivation in running. Im curious to see if it I can detect when I was most consistent in my running and potentially identify when certain injuries or illnesses occured.<br />
